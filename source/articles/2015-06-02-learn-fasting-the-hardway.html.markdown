Today will mark the 6th day of my water fast. For those who don't know - a water fast is simply reducing your caloretic intake to only water. I have no intention to go into the ends and outs on fasting
others have done over and over. Just know that fasting is a timeless tradition practiced by most if not all religions. While this was not my intent, I can say I feel I have an improved
well being over the last few days. Especially now that I am nearing the end of my fast.

To that extent I thought it might be worth posting the things that I feel really helped me to make it through this. In tandem will list out what my day to day has been like to give readers a look at
what my experience has been like through course of the fast.

Starting off I think its worth sharing that this is my 10th attempt in recent time at doing a prolong fast. I had done a few fasts before in my early twenties, 1-3 days mostly
with my longest being 4.5 days. I had a real hard time adjusting and getting through the initial hump; which is the fist 3 days. After going most the day with out food I would seem to break down
and just give into the urge of wanting to eat. This time around I fell I prepared better both mentally and physically to endure a prolong fast.

###Preparation
Starting Weight: Guessing 204 - 203 lbs

First off I made sure to stick to a strict paleo diet for the fist two weeks. No cheat days or one offs, just meat and veggies with some kombucha at dinner. On the day prior to fasting I drank
only freshly squeezed vegetable juice and some water with a splash of apple cider vinegar. I feel this is one of the biggest keys as it allowed my body to acclimate a bit, and gave me a buffer
to mentally adjust as well.

I started juice fasting on a Friday to make my work day pass a little easier. Each time I felt a little weak, I'd take a few sips from my juice bottle. I thought it best in this case not to drink the
full amount but only give my body enough to settle the urge. It had some points that were difficult, yet it helped my mind to see the road ahead.

###Day One
Weigh in: No Record

I started water fasting on a Saturday. I worked to keep busy by running errands to prep for my trip out west and playing a little Destiny on the side. When I wanted to eat I would
simply distract or refocus. I recall taking a long nap on the first, when the hunger would hit hard, sleeping it off was the best remedy.

###Day Two
Weigh in: 201 lbs

Surprised to find that my hunger cravings had passed. I felt no movement in my stomach and didn't really think about food for the most part. Well at least not until I did something really stupid.

One of my daughters came down with a fever reaching 102. Our other daughter had an ear infection so some germs were all about. When taking my daughters temperature, I wanted to test the
thermometer to ensure the reading was accurate. After taking her temp, I let the thermometer cool then took my own. I checked mine, all looked good, and then took hers again, same reading as before.
Then I thought, good job fella, now you likely are to catch what she has. After this I decided pop a couple vitamin C's to help ward off the germs.

All of a sudden I felt a tsunami deep with in my stomach. It felt like the inner workers of an old steam factory reanimated after sitting idle for a century. With in a matter of an hour or two the
hunger pangs came back with a vengeance. Food, bacon just a few bites of that banana sitting on the bread box (not my bread box) my stomach screamed. At this point I reasoned it would be worth taking
another nap.

#Day Three
Weigh in: 199.4 lbs

By no stretch - this was the hardest day. I dreaded the thought of going back to work, sitting at my desk and finding a way to be productive. Further I was concerned my interactions with others
might be unpredictable given I was dragging ass on the inside. On top of that, I was still fighting hunger pangs from the day before.

My wife was worried about our eldest daughter and wanted me to stay home to ensure that if she needed to be taken to the doctor, I would be there to help. A gave it a thought and it seemed to be a
win win, so I quickly agreed.

The day started off with a hour meeting. The meeting went smooth as I always feel more energized in the mornings while fasting. From there it was just a normal day, a little code and some design work to follow.
By early afternoon, I was struggling a bit with a headache. This was my body releasing toxins from built up fat stores to be expunged. By 2'oclock, I wanted food bad. My mind was justifying reasons to eat
my body was in whole heart agreement with everything it was suggesting and my will was passive in all of this.

All I knew was that I didn't want to given in. I wanted to see this through for a range of reasons and felt like quiting after 3 days in would be a waste. Since I was working I couldn't go run errands
take a nap or play video games. The best I could do was play some audio on the side while keeping up with my day to day.

At this point I pulled up youtube on my second browser, and typed in 'Fasting Tips'. This lead me to a couple of folks, one who calls himself LCC - Low Carb Corey. The guy is a bit sensational, but with
effect. Another was Loren Lockman who runs a fasting retreat in Costa Rica. Loren had multiple videos to listen to and the more I absorbed the content the more I wanted nothing to do with food... at
least not till Saturday.

Watching Corey's posts made me want to do a little bit more. He went on a 7 day fast like I'm on now and took it like a champ. The guy worked out frequently and gave some pretty solid advice about doing
this while in a fasted state.

After the day was up and getting my mind right I decided to go for a run to see how my body would respond. I ran about 3 miles at a 10/min mile pace. Surprisingly I felt energized and no different from
when I am deep in ketosis. After the run my hunger pangs passed - another surprise and all in all I felt great.

#Day Four
Weigh in: 196.2 lbs

I woke up the next morning feeling great. At the office things were smooth sailing and I didn't feel hindered at all by the fast. People were curious why I was passing on the free lunch going around
this week, but I just let them know that I was good. When I got home I watched some more fasting videos to keep my mind in check.

#Day Five
Weigh in: 194.3 lbs

Another good day at work, I started off the day by leading a meeting. I felt quick, alert and even a little sharper than I normally am. At lunch I popped into the gym and did some squats,
pull ups, kettle swings and lift bar curls. Nothing to hard but I did work up a sweat.

After the workout, I felt the right side of my chest kind of tense up. This is unusual. When I got back to my desk I did some googling and landed on this [article](http://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/)
posted on Paleo Leap.

The article certainly helped me become more aware of the potential dangers to fasting over just focusing on the benefits. Some of the examples seemed to be a bit conditional, like the lady who passed away
in recent years from a 3 week religious fast. They fail to mention that she had done it 4 times that year. Additionally it does not appear an autopsy was posted to suggest whether on not fasting was the full
a contributor to her passing. Hard to think otherwise but I can imagine, at least in her case there could of been other reasons.

When I arrived home from work, my legs were burning like lava rocks. Fighting the want to eat and the burning in my hamstrings I choose to look for relief. There is a acupressure join at our
mall down the street that I decided to hit up. Arriving I was paired with an older gentlemen who put the whop-ass on my hams and calf's. Forty-five minute and I was good as new... almost.

I wore myself out pretty good that day and hit the sack early.

#Day Six
Weigh in: 192.7 lbs

My legs woke up feeling amazing, no hunger cravings just a little light headed when I stood up - but thats to be expected. Work day is good, given its a short week and here I am writing this blog post.
