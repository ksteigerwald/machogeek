Whats on this grill? Beef spare ribs and brisket. This will be the first attempt at trying to smoke meat on a gas grill. It feels unorthodox!

I picked up a smoke box from Ace to help balance the heat. This little Home Depot Char-Broil grill has done wonders with steaks and chicken wings in the past, figured its up for a promotion.

Just in case things go wrong, I have a classic Webber handling two ribs and the brisket.
