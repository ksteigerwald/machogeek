My intention here is to build out a vocabulary sheet of UI/UX patterns and practices. While I am confident others have done this before, I want to write them out for myself to help make the terms stick. I aim to crawl the web and compile a long list of UI/UX terms and examples. 

When complete, if ever; I will have a nice glossary of patterns to consider and take inspiration from when starting a design project. Some examples will be linked, others will be drawn out.
